# CLAUDE.MD -- Empirical Social Science Research with Claude Code

<!-- HOW TO USE: Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your project info.
     Customize Beamer environments for your talk preamble.
     Keep this file under ~150 lines — Claude loads it every session.
     See the guide at https://hugosantanna.github.io/clo-author/ for full documentation. -->

**Field:** [YOUR FIELD — e.g., Economics, Finance, Marketing, Management, Accounting]
**Branch:** main

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- Paper `main.tex` is authoritative; talks and supplements derive from it
- **Quality gates** -- weighted aggregate score; nothing ships below 80/100; see `quality.md`
- **Worker-critic pairs** -- every creator has a paired critic; critics never edit files
- **Auto-memory** -- corrections and preferences are saved automatically via Claude Code's built-in memory system

## Getting Started

1. Fill in the `[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]` in this file
2. Run `/discover interview [topic]` to build your research specification
3. Or run `/new-project [topic]` for the full orchestrated pipeline

## Quality Thresholds

| Score | Gate | Applies To |
|-------|------|------------|
| 80 | Commit | Weighted aggregate (blocking) |
| 90 | PR | Weighted aggregate (blocking) |
| 95 | Submission | Aggregate + all components >= 80 |
| -- | Advisory | Talks (reported, non-blocking) |

See `quality.md` for weighted aggregation formula.

## Skills Quick Reference

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new-project [topic]` | Full pipeline: idea → paper (orchestrated) |
| `/discover [mode] [topic]` | Discovery: interview, literature, data, ideation |
| `/strategize [question]` | Identification strategy or pre-analysis plan |
| `/analyze [dataset]` | End-to-end data analysis |
| `/write [section]` | Draft paper sections + humanizer pass |
| `/review [file/--flag]` | Quality reviews (routes by target: paper, code, peer) |
| `/revise [report]` | R&R cycle: classify + route referee comments |
| `/talk [mode] [format]` | Create, audit, or compile Beamer presentations |
| `/submit [mode]` | Journal targeting → package → audit → final gate |
| `/tools [subcommand]` | Utilities: commit, compile, validate-bib, journal, etc. |
