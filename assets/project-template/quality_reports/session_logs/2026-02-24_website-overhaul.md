# Session Log: Full Website Overhaul — The Clo-Author

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Goal:** Reproduce Hugo Sant'Anna's website locally, overhaul theme/blog/content, add comprehensive Clo-Author guide page with visual flowcharts

## Context

Continuing from the previous session that reoriented claude-code-my-workflow from lecture-centric to applied econometrics research ("The Clo-Author"). This session focuses on the website (hsantanna.org / hugosantanna.github.io).

## Changes Made

| Action | File | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| CLONE | `/Users/hsantanna/Work/Research/hsantanna-site-local/` | Full site repo |
| REWRITE | `Gemfile` | Dropped `github-pages`, added `jekyll ~> 4.4` + `minimal-mistakes-jekyll` + `logger`/`csv`/`base64` |
| REWRITE | `_config.yml` | `theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll`, updated bio/email, added nav |
| CREATE | `assets/css/main.scss` | Navy/gold palette, Georgia serif, JetBrains Mono code, custom classes |
| CREATE | `_includes/head/custom.html` | GA4 + MathJax 3.x + JetBrains Mono font load |
| CREATE | `_includes/footer/custom.html`, `_includes/after-content.html` | Required by gem layout |
| UPDATE | `_data/authors.yml` | "Assistant Professor at UAB", removed UGA links |
| UPDATE | `_data/navigation.yml` | Added "The Clo-Author" nav item |
| UPDATE | `_includes/mathjax-custom.html` | MathJax 2.x → 3.x |
| DELETE | `_layouts/default.html` | Removed stale MM 4.22 layout (gem 4.27 provides it) |
| DELETE | `_sass/minimal-mistakes/`, `_sass/minimal-mistakes.scss` | Removed vendored sass (gem provides) |
| DELETE | `about.markdown` | Duplicate of `about.md` |
| UPDATE | `index.md` | Added Clo-Author announcement box |
| CREATE | `clo-author.md` | Comprehensive guide: Quick Start, agents, skills, pipeline, FAQ |

## Design Decisions

- **Jekyll 4.4 over Hugo** — quick fix for Ruby 4.0 compat; Hugo migration deferred
- **Navy #1a1a2e + Gold #c9a227** — professional academic palette
- **Georgia serif body + JetBrains Mono code** — academic feel with nerdy code aesthetic
- **Sass deprecation warnings** — from MM's vendored code, harmless, upstream issue

## Status

- Jekyll server running at http://127.0.0.1:4001/ (PID 90645)
- All pages build successfully
- SVG flowcharts created and rendering

## Open Items

- Push changes to hugosantanna.github.io repo
- Rename GitHub repo to the-clo-author
- Update README.md with Clo-Author branding
- Visual review in browser (user should check rendering)
