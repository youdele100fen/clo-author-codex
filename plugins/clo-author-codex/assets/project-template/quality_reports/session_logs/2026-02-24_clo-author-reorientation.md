# Session Log: Reorient Workflow to Applied Econometrics Research

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Goal:** Transform claude-code-my-workflow from lecture-centric to applied econometrics research publication workflow, branded as "The Clo-Author"

## Changes Made

| Action | File | Phase |
|--------|------|-------|
| REWRITE | `CLAUDE.md` — paper-centric constitution | 1 |
| REWRITE | `.claude/rules/single-source-of-truth.md` — Paper → Talks chain | 1 |
| REWRITE | `.claude/rules/verification-protocol.md` — removed Quarto, added Paper LaTeX | 1 |
| REWRITE | `.claude/rules/quality-gates.md` — paper (blocking) + talks (advisory) | 1 |
| ARCHIVE | `beamer-quarto-sync.md`, `knowledge-base-template.md` → `rules/archive/` | 1 |
| ARCHIVE | `translate-to-quarto`, `qa-quarto`, `extract-tikz`, `pedagogy-review` → `skills/archive/` | 1 |
| CREATE | `Paper/`, `Tables/`, `Supplementary/`, `Replication/`, `Talks/` directories | 1 |
| CREATE | `.claude/agents/econometrician.md` — 6-lens causal inference reviewer | 2 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/econometrics-check/SKILL.md` | 2 |
| MODIFY | `.claude/rules/r-code-conventions.md` — 12 econometrics pitfalls | 2 |
| MODIFY | `.claude/agents/domain-reviewer.md` — cross-reference to econometrician | 2 |
| MODIFY | `.claude/skills/lit-review/SKILL.md` — economics-specific upgrade | 3 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/draft-paper/SKILL.md` | 3 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/respond-to-referee/SKILL.md` | 3 |
| CREATE | `.claude/agents/replication-auditor.md` — 6-check AEA auditor | 4 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/audit-replication/SKILL.md` | 4 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/data-deposit/SKILL.md` | 4 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/pre-analysis-plan/SKILL.md` | 4 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/target-journal/SKILL.md` | 4 |
| MODIFY | `.claude/rules/replication-protocol.md` — Phase 5 data deposit | 4 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/paper-excellence/SKILL.md` | 5 |
| CREATE | `.claude/skills/create-talk/SKILL.md` | 5 |
| REWRITE | `.claude/WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md` — research-focused | 5 |

## Design Decisions

- **Archive, don't delete** lecture-only infrastructure — preserves template value
- **Design-opinionated, package-flexible** — econometrician recommends CS DiD, fixest, rdrobust but accepts fastdid, did2s, augsynth, etc.
- **Two-tier scoring** — paper score blocks (80/90/95), talk scores advisory only
- **Zero always-on context cost** — all new content in agents/skills (on-demand) or path-scoped rules
- **Paper/main.tex is new SSOT** — Talks/ are derivative Beamer presentations in 4 formats

## Branding

- Project name: "The Clo-Author: Your Econ AI Research Assistant for Claude Code"
- Based on Pedro Sant'Anna's claude-code-my-workflow template
- User: Hugo Sant'Anna, UAB (NOT Pedro Sant'Anna)
- GitHub: hugosantanna
- Website: hsantanna.org (Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes at hugosantanna.github.io)

## Website Content Created

- `/tmp/hsantanna-site/index.md` — front page with Clo-Author announcement block
- `/tmp/hsantanna-site/clo-author.md` — dedicated project page
- `/tmp/clo-author-preview.html` — standalone HTML preview (opened in browser)

## Open Items

- Push website changes to hugosantanna.github.io repo
- Rename GitHub repo from claude-code-my-workflow to the-clo-author
- Update README.md with Clo-Author branding
- Add /clo-author/ to site navigation in _config.yml
- Jekyll local preview failed (Ruby 4.0 incompatible with Jekyll 3.9/github-pages gem)

## Learnings

- [LEARN:identity] User is Hugo Sant'Anna from UAB, NOT Pedro Sant'Anna
- [LEARN:jekyll] github-pages gem pins Jekyll 3.9 which is incompatible with Ruby 4.0 (Homebrew latest). Don't try to run locally without rbenv pinning to Ruby 3.x.
