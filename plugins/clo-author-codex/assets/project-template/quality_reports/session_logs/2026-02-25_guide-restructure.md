# Session Log: Guide Restructure into 3-Document Quarto Website

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Goal:** Split monolithic `guide/workflow-guide.qmd` (~1700 lines) into 3 focused documents rendered as a Quarto website with sidebar navigation.

## Plan

Approved plan: `quality_reports/plans/` (saved in prior session). Split into:
1. `index.qmd` — Quick Start landing page (~120 lines)
2. `user-guide.qmd` — User Guide: what you can do (~500 lines)
3. `architecture.qmd` — Architecture Reference: how the system works (~700 lines)

## Decisions

- **Quarto website type** (`type: website`) with navbar, not single-page TOC
- **Output to `../docs/`** directly from Quarto (no manual copy)
- **Jekyll redirect** via meta-refresh at `clo-author.md`, sidebar nav removed entirely
- **custom.scss WIP notice** replaced with navbar styling (no longer a single-page doc)
- **Slide/lecture content** demoted to "Additional Workflows" section in Architecture Reference
- **Guide link in README** updated to point to GitHub Pages URL

## Implementation (completed)

1. Rewrote `guide/_quarto.yml` as website project config
2. Created `guide/index.qmd` (116 lines) — Quick Start
3. Created `guide/user-guide.qmd` (365 lines) — User Guide
4. Created `guide/architecture.qmd` (628 lines) — Architecture Reference
5. Updated `guide/custom.scss` — replaced WIP notice with navbar styling
6. Deleted `guide/workflow-guide.qmd`, `docs/index.html`, `docs/workflow-guide.html`
7. Ran `quarto render` — all 3 pages rendered successfully
8. Updated `README.md` guide link → `hugosantanna.github.io/clo-author`
9. Updated `CLAUDE.md` comment reference
10. Rewrote `hsantanna-site-local/clo-author.md` as redirect page
11. Removed sidebar nav block from `hsantanna-site-local/_data/navigation.yml`

## Verification

- All 3 HTML files generated in `docs/`
- Cross-page links verified (including anchor links like `architecture.qmd#additional-workflows-slides-lectures`)
- Navbar present on all pages
- Line counts within targets: 116, 365, 628 (total 1109 vs original 1700)
- No SVGs needed (none existed in repo)

## Status

- **Done:** Full restructure implemented and verified
- **Pending:** Commit, push, test Jekyll redirect locally, verify GitHub Pages deployment
