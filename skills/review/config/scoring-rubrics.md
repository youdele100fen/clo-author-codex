## Strategist-Critic (Causal Audit)

The strategist-critic does not use a point-deduction rubric. Instead, it classifies issues by severity:

| Severity | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Identification is wrong or unsupported. Fatal design flaw. |
| **MAJOR** | Missing important check or wrong inference. Should fix before publication. |
| **MINOR** | Could strengthen but paper works without it. Nice to have. |

**Overall assessment scale:**
- **SOUND** -- Design is valid, implementation is correct
- **MINOR ISSUES** -- Fixable concerns, none threatening core results
- **MAJOR ISSUES** -- Significant concerns that could change conclusions
- **CRITICAL ERRORS** -- Fundamental design flaw or incorrect implementation

**Proportional criticism principle:** A working paper missing Oster bounds is MINOR. A paper with violated parallel trends is CRITICAL.

## Theorist-Critic (Theory Review)

| | Uniform convergence claim without Donsker / VC / bracketing argument | -10 |
| | Taylor remainder not shown to be $o_p/O_p$ at claimed rate | -10 per instance |
| | Rate arithmetic wrong | -15 |
| **Identification** | Substitution from counterfactual to observable is unjustified | -20 |
| | Design invariant invoked without being stated (parallel trends / exclusion / monotonicity / continuity) | -15 |
| **Statements** | Over-claim (conclusion exceeds what proof supports) | -15 |
| | Under-claim (proof supports strictly more) | -3 |
| | Pointwise vs. uniform conflation | -10 |
| **Assumptions** | Assumption never used in the proof | -5 per assumption |
| | Assumption not interpreted (no plain-language gloss) | -3 per assumption |
| | High-level condition with no primitive counterpart and no justification | -5 |
